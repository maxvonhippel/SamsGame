The Tiny Peemer was originally a fairy-fly which is the smallest insect in the world.  \'93Peemer\'94 is a word which some kids use to say \'93gun.\'94  Sometimes kids make up new words that are stupid for things like \'93gun\'94 because otherwise they could get in trouble for talking about those things.  So it\'92s mainly a code.  Um, its range is infinite, on forever, because it shoots lasers.  It is the plane that you start off with.  So it costs nothing.}
