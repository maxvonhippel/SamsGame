The Uncle Taser shoots tasers which I think are basically just lasers.  It electrocutes its enemies.  It is called the \'93Uncle\'94 Taser because my brother when he made this game didn\'92t hear me right and I said something different (really I did say something different Max you just don't listen) but we are keeping the name now.  Originally it was a mite which is the oldest type of insect according to the Rutgers entomologist Karl Kjer, who might be wrong, I don\'92t know, we just googled \'93oldest insect\'94 and that\'92s what we found.  It costs $3,000.  I mean $3,000,000.  It costs $3,000,000.  To be clear.}
