The Ripper of Planes was an ant, which means that it collects gold and destroys other mutant machines.  It is really strong for its size since it can carry 3 times its own weight so that means that if three ships hits The Ripper of Planes it takes no damage.  It costs $1,000,000 and its range is as far as you can see on the screen.}
