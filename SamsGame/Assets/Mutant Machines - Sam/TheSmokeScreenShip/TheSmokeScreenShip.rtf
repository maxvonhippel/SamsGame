The Smoke Screen Ship was a butterfly originally and is very deceptive, so it uses smoke to trick you.  For this reason it is hard to hit so it has to be hit twice in one spot to puncture the smoke screen and then a third time in that spot to actually hit the plane, but it heals up after 20 seconds.  Its range is 13 feet.  It costs $7,000,000.}
