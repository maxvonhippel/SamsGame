# SamsGame
This is an arcade style space shooter video game built by Max von Hippel (19) and Sam von Hippel (9).

# License
You do not have permission to use this game for any project until after I have published Sam's Game on the iOS App Store.
After that, you (you = anyone reading this) may read use anything in this project for any cool project of your own, so long as it is distinct and diffferent in nature and implementation from Sam's Game.  Also, if you use any of this for your own project, send me a link so Sam and I can check it out.

I will figure out a better, more legally binding/intimidating looking legal document thingy later.  For now, just be a good person.  And enjoy!

You can read more about this project [on my dev blog](http://linkedandloaded.ninja).
