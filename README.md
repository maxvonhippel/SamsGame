# SamsGame
This is an arcade style space shooter video game built by Max von Hippel (born 1996) and Sam von Hippel (born 2006).

TO BE VERY CLEAR, this is something I am doing for fun, occaisionally, on the weekends, with my brother.  It is not meant to be in any way a demonstration of my sick hacker skillz or coding finnese.  If you are an employer looking to see if I really have those nifty coding chops I claim to have, check out my other work, like the dope html-hacking Amazon SDK I made, or my contribution to PruneCluster, or whatever else you see in my profile, or look at my Stack Overflow.  This repo is for entertainment purposes only.

# License
You do not have permission to use this game for any project until after I have published Sam's Game on the iOS App Store.
After that, you (you = anyone reading this) may read use anything in this project for any cool project of your own, so long as it is distinct and diffferent in nature and implementation from Sam's Game.  Also, if you use any of this for your own project, send me a link so Sam and I can check it out.

I will figure out a better, more legally binding/intimidating looking legal document thingy later.  For now, just be a good person.  And enjoy!

You can read more about this project [on my dev blog](http://linkedandloaded.ninja).
